<!-- The command-line interface, sometimes referred to as the CLI, is a tool into which you can type text commands to perform specific tasks -->
<!-- comand lines =  successive lines of text-->


<!-- BASIC COMANDS FOR MAC -->
<!-- to see all the files and subfolders within a directory, the command is ls  -->
<!--ls -a. This command will show all the hidden files.  -->
<!-- If you want to clear the screen, the command is clear. -->
<!-- A better way to list the files in a large directory is ls -la -->
<!--create a new directory. Using the mkdir command followed by the directory name: mkdir testdir  -->
<!-- change into that directory with the cd command: cd testdir -->
<!--o create a Ruby file inside this directory, use the touch command followed by the file name: touch my_file.rb.  -->
<!--  r stands for read, w stands for write and x stands for executable-->

<!-- CHANGING FILE NAME -->
<!-- To change the name of the file use the mv command followed by the current file name and then the new file name: mv my_file.rb my_other_file_name.rb . -->

<!-- TAB KEY -->
<!-- tab is an important key in the command line, as it acts as an auto complete. -->

<!-- MOVING BACK -->
<!-- .. -->
<!-- The complete syntax is: cd .. -->

<!-- REMOVING A FILE -->
<!--  touch = to create a new file. -->
<!--command is: touch another_file.rb    Removes file --> 
<!-- rm and file name delete files also = rm another_file.rb-->

<!-- REMOVING DIRECTORY -->
<!-- The command to remove a directory is rm -rf and the name of the directory you want to remove -->
<!-- Eg: rm -rf nested_dir -->
<!-- Remember, it doesn't put the files in trash, but removes them completely from your system. So, be extremely careful while using this command. -->

<!-- CREATING CONTENT -->
<!-- way to add content to a file is with the angle bracket >. An example of this is: echo "my content" > my_file.rb -->
<!-- To add to the file instead of replacing it, we will use >> to append new content -->

<!-- COPYING FILES -->
<!-- copy files = cp -->
<!-- Example = cp my_file.rb my_new_file.rb -->

<!-- AUTOMATING WORKFLOW -->
<!-- You can google bash and the automated process you are looking for and you will often find the code you need. -->
