/* grid-column and grid-row is these as you can see right here this is shorthand for a few other commands  */

/* commands like grid columns start grid column and grid rows start and then grid row end.*/

/*  start at 1 and then we when you ever anytime you see a negative one what that means is you want it to go to 
the very end */

/* the very first element is the start line and the next one after the slash is the end line */


/* In their example of this, you could say grid-column: 3 / span 2;, which means this is a start line and 
then you want it to span two columns whenever we say that we want it to be negative 1 that means we actually 
want it to go to the very end and take up all that space. */

/* "Grid is designed to be used with flex box not instead of it."  */

/* "There's nothing wrong with this approach. However, with CSS grid, it's just as easy to redefine the number of columns. 
By using -1, you can be sure that your content will always reach the end." */

/* Anytime you see a negative one what that means is that it makes sure that the values are going all the way to the end. */
