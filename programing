When programming, we are giving instructions to the computer

We have to write in a language the computer can interpret and turn into an actionable code

The system will compile this code into a set of ones and zeros for the actual computerâ€™s processing

For a more complex sample, we can put in a link to an API inside. This is something on the Internet or some other API that stores data.
     Using this set of instructions, the system will convert and perform the print statement just as before.

the reality behind all this complexity is that we are simply formatting instructions for computers to be able to execute them.
