 var num = 5 + (5 * 10) / 6**2 - 1; //  5.38
 var num = 5 / 5 * 4; // 4

// order of operations mostly follows -That is, that it does not read it from left to right, instead it dissects it and it looks to see each one of the operators and then it puts a priority based on that


 var num = 5+ 5 * 10; // 55
// The way that it works, is first five is multiplied by 10, which would equal 50. Then the 50 added to 5. That's where we get 55.
